// intermediate sorting
// learning seperate bc theyre faster but harder and less intuitive

// understand the limitations of the previous sorting algs
// merge, radix and quick sort

// these are MUCH FASTER
// all their time complexities improve previous sorting from O(n^2) to O(n * log n)

// tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
// these are far less simpler
