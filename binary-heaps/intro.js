// Heaps

// Similar to Binary Search Tree
// Min and Max Heaps

// MaxBinaryHeap - Parent node is always larger than child nodes
// Each parent node has at most two child nodes
// No guarantees between sibling nodes
// Compact as possible, each node is as full as possible, left node is filled out first

// MinBinaryHeap - Parent node is always smaller than child node

// why do we need to know this?
// commonly used to implement priority queue
