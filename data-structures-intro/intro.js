// data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them,
// and the function or operations that can be applied to the data

// arrays and objects are data structures too!

// why so many?? 
// different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized
// while others are more generally used (like arrays)

// why care??
// the more time you spend as a developer, the more likely youll need to use one of these data structures
// you've already worked with many of them without knowing!
// and of course....INTERVIEWS

// there is no one best data structure

// there is a ton of content, don't get overwhelmed to master it all at once
// don't do it all at once
