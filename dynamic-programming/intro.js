// Dynamic Programming
// "A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions."

// It only works on problems with 
// OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE    &
// OVERLAPPING SUBPROBLEMS

// OVERLAPPING
// SUBPROBLEMS
// A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times

// FIBONACCI SEQUENCE
// "Every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones"

// OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE
// A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
