// Djikstra's Algorithm
// Uses Graphs + Priority Queues with Binary Heap
// One of the most famous and widely used algorithm around

// Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph

// Why is it useful?
// GPS - finding fastest route
// Network routing - finds open shortest path for data
// Biology - used to model sthe spread of a virus between humans
// airlines - same principle as GPS
