// Graphs

// A graph data structure consists of a finite set of nodes, together with a set of unordered pairs
// for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph

// Uses for Graphs
// Social Networks
// Location / Mapping
// Routing Algorithms
// Visual hierarchy
// file system structure

// Types of Graphs
// Vertex - a node
// Edge - Connection between nodes
// Undirected - no polarity to the edges - two way connections
// Directed - represented with arrows - polarity with each edge - one way connections
// Weighted - has value for each edge
// Unweighted - has no value for each edge
