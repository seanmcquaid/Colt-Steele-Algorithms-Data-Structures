// Trees

// a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent and child relationship

// lists - linear
// trees - non linear

// root - top node in a tree
// child - a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root 
// parent - the converse notion of a child
// siblings - a group nodes with the same parent
// leaf - a node with no children

// Uses for Trees
// HTML DOM
// Network Routing
// Abstract Syntax Tree
// AI

// Kinds of Trees
// Trees
// Binary Trees
// Binary Search Trees

// How Binary Search Trees Work
// Every parent node has at most two children nodes
// every node to the left of a parent node is always LESS than the parent
// every node to the right of a parent node is always GREATER than the parent
