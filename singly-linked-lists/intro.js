// linked list
// a data structure that contains a head, tail and length property

// linked lists consist of nodes and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

// head = beginning
// tail = end

// think of it like a skyscraper with no elevators

// each node is only connected one direction - hence a singly linked list

// comparisons with arrays

// lists
// dont have indexes
// connected via nodes with a NEXT pointer
// random access is not allowed

// arrays
// indexed in order
// insertion and deletion can be expensive
// can quickly be accesed at a specific index
